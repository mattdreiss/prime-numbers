# Prime Number Generation

Compares two methods of generating ranges of prime numbers. The first method uses division to determine if an integer 
is prime or not and the second method implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes. The performance tests demonstrate the
strengths and the weaknesses of each method.

Future expansion includes implementing the Sieve of Atkin.
